# CrisisLink Vagrant Setup Improvements

This document explains the improvements made to the CrisisLink Vagrant configuration to ensure smooth operation and avoid common issues.

## Changes Made

### Vagrantfile Improvements

1. **Automated Provisioning**

   - Modified Vagrantfile to run the provision script automatically on `vagrant up`
   - Eliminated the manual step of running `sudo bash /vagrant/provision.sh`

2. **Headless Operation**

   - Changed `vb.gui = true` to `vb.gui = false` for better performance
   - VM now runs in headless mode (no GUI needed)

3. **Improved Post-Up Message**
   - Updated message to indicate that setup is complete
   - Added clear instructions for accessing the application

### provision.sh Improvements

1. **Fixed bcrypt Module Issue**

   - Added automatic rebuilding of the bcrypt module
   - Uses `npm rebuild bcrypt --build-from-source` to ensure native code compiles correctly for the VM environment
   - Prevents the `ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED` error that was causing the backend to crash

2. **Added Service Status Verification**

   - Added checks to verify both frontend and backend services are running
   - Will attempt to restart the service if not detected after initial startup

3. **Added Network Tools**

   - Installed `net-tools` package for easier troubleshooting
   - Allows users to check port usage with `netstat` command

4. **Added Troubleshooting Instructions**
   - Added detailed service and troubleshooting commands to the output
   - Makes it easier for users to resolve issues if they occur

### README.md Improvements

1. **Simplified Setup Instructions**

   - Updated to reflect the fully automated setup process
   - Clarified that no manual steps are required

2. **Enhanced Troubleshooting Section**

   - Added specific commands to check service status
   - Added instructions to view logs and restart services
   - Added steps to fix bcrypt issues if they occur
   - Added network port verification commands

3. **Repository Information**
   - Updated repository links and names

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **One-Command Setup**

   - Users can now set up the entire environment with just `vagrant up`
   - No manual intervention required

2. **Reliability**

   - Fixed the native module issues that were causing the backend to fail
   - Added verification steps to ensure services are running properly

3. **Better Troubleshooting**
   - Added tools and instructions to help users diagnose and fix issues
   - Improved documentation with specific commands

## Testing Verification

The updated configuration has been tested and verified to:

1. Successfully set up the VM
2. Install all dependencies
3. Fix the bcrypt module issue
4. Start both frontend and backend services
5. Make the application accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
